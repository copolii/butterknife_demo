# Butterknife Demo

This repository contains the source code for my Butterknife introduction, which is the 2nd installment of my [_Code More Efficiently Series_](http://www.mahram.ca/code-more-efficiently "Code More Efficiently")

The slides are on [_Google Drive_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12pQCi23Sia_D7g_R9UUOwd87e_I0PZRmRHVtPqK_wdg/edit?usp=sharing "Butter Knife Slides") and short write up is on [_my blog_](http://www.mahram.ca/cme_butter-knife "Butter Knife: View Injection Library for Android").

To run the demo, build using Android Studio and run as you would any other Android Project.

Comments and feedback are always welcome.
